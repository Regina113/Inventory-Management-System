# Inventory-Management-System
Project Overview 
- This SQL project simulates an Inventory Management System for a mid-sized company. It focuses on tracking products, stock levels, suppliers, warehouses, and purchase orders to ensure efficient supply chain and stock control.
- The project demonstrates the design of a normalized relational database schema, insertion of sample data, and solving real-world business questions using SQL queries.

Database Schema
The system includes the following key tables:
Categories – Classifies products (e.g., Electronics, Furniture).
Suppliers – Contains supplier details and contact info.
Products – Stores product information including price, category, and supplier.
Warehouses – Tracks where inventory is stored.
Inventory – Monitors quantity of products in specific warehouses.
PurchaseOrders – Records orders placed with suppliers.
OrderDetails – Tracks items in each purchase order.

Business Questions Answered
The project addresses the following business problems:
Low Stock Products – Identifying products below reorder levels.
Supplier Delivery Performance – Finding suppliers with delayed deliveries in the last 60 days.
Dead Stock – Listing products not ordered in the past 6 months or never ordered.
Warehouse Distribution – Showing product quantities per warehouse.
Top Ordered Products – Ranking products by total units ordered.
Spending Trends – Summarizing total supplier spend per month.
Each question is answered using efficient SQL queries compatible with MySQL.
